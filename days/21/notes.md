Wow.

Part 1 of this day is a very straightforward exploration task.

Part 2 *completely* eludes me.
I'm going to take a look at other people's solutions and probably get humbled by how obvious the one critical thing is I missed.
But my solution is based on many sheets of paper, has consumed many written-to-disk debugging images, and fuels a steadfast belief that this task is MUCH simpler than I made it be.
It *has* to be, because otherwise this would not be a good AoC task, and I refuse to believe that.
