This is on-brand AoC.

Part 1 is a beautiful parsing and structure-building task.

Part 2 throws in end-of-universe compute times and requires a shortcut.
The shortcut is very well-behaved (no offsets, all module periods are primes) and immediately yields the solution.
I was a little disappointed because I couldn't get the program to end "naturally" in the correct iteration, but I did not have the motivation to find out exactly how to manipulate the program state to make that happen.
