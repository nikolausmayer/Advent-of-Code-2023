This is an astonishingly difficult AoC day 25.

The problem boils down to a graph min-cut, but it's been way too many years since I have actually understood the algorithms for that, so for this i just grabbed something of GitHub and extended it to keep track of the resulting graph partitions (because we need the partition sizes in the end).
