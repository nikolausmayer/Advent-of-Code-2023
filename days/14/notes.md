Part 1 is simple; there's probably a very elegant solution but just bruteforcing it works just as well.

Part 2 is a fantastic AoC staple.
My solution takes a memory-maximalist approach and just crams the entire current vector-of-strings state into a map, so that's not scalable, but I wasn't going to lookup C++ hashing specifics unless I had to.
The loop happens mercifully early.

I **love** these loop-skipping tasks.
