Part 1 is delightful, but (a bit too much) simpler than some previous years' tasks which needed keeping track of a whole connectivity graph.

Part 2 was humbling.
Not because it's *hard*, but because I went on an hour-long sidetrack of splitting hypercubes to deduplicate multiply counted volumes, only to find that there aren't and and I took the wrong starting value ranges for all dimensions and I'm stupid.
It's a great day.
