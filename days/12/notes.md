Part 1 of this day looks *so much* like a recursive explosion that I immediately went for a dynamic programming approach.
This absolutely saved me in part 2 and I only needed to add the trivial step of unfolding the records.

(well, I *say* trivial, but I of course overread "separated by `?`" and proceeded to be frustrated by my wrong result... then wrongly implemented adding the `?` which lead to further disappointment)
